# :alien: Make Yourself a Bot :alien:
make yourself a chat bot. (private web mode)

Very easy to get started project with bots. In fact, I don't think there's an easier way.

## Test it here:  https://cleverbots.net/  https://resume1.cleverbots.net

### Step 1 :fire: What you need to know :fire:

<ul>
<li>a) some basic knowledge of Python + Flask <br />  see here for getting started with python: https://medium.com/@AndroidAdvance/step-by-step-on-learning-python-programming-easiest-way-in-the-world-8b5a5b4741f7</li>
<li>b) some basic knowledge of html/css + a little bit of javascript</li>
<li>c) some basic knowledge of how IBM Watson Works.</li>
<li>e) you should know the difference between http and https</li>
</ul>

:fire: Without the things that are listed above you won't be able to do anything with this code.
In case you get stuck, it means your basic knowledge about X is ... sub - basic. Invest more time into learning the basics or ask some help from friends (not here on github, because I don't have time to learn you something that you can easily find on net, youtube etc...)

#### For someone with NO programming experience, this is 2-3 months of work. For someone with some experience this is ~1 week. For someone with good exp. this is 1-2 days. I can't think of a faster way, except if you follow the tutorials monkey see - monkey copypaste without understanding anything while you do it.

### Step 2

Clone the repo. see what's inside

### Step 3

Create an account in ibm watson (the free one, no credit card needed). Optional: create an account into google's Firebase if you want to store the messages. [I choose firebase because it's the easiest to work with for small ammounts of data]

### Step 4
???

### Step 5
Profit

## Please star this repository and fork it :) Thank you. It's the least you can do for my work that is free.

## :alien: TODO List
Waiting for your suggestions/bug reports
